## Overview
A list of research papers on out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in time series. Existing studies categorize the problem from three key perspectives: data distribution, representation learning, and OOD evaluation. For more details, please refer to our survey paper, *"Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Time Series: A Survey."*

## Data Distribution
Real-world data distributions are often dynamic rather than static and frequently subject to various distribution shifts that challenge the assumptions made during training. Two common distribution shifts are covariate and concept shifts.
