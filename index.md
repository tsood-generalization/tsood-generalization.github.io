## Overview
A list of research papers on out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in time series. Existing studies categorize the problem from three key perspectives: data distribution, representation learning, and OOD evaluation. For more details, please refer to our survey paper, *"Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Time Series: A Survey."*
